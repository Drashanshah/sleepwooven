<h2>Wake up every morning to your full potential</h2>
<p>From decades of family manufacturing experience, we found the most important factors in creating the most luxurious and comfortable bedding come down to a few simple factors: the cotton source and fabric finishing.</p>

<p>Cotton is a natural crop with various fiber length; some are bound to be shorter and weaker than others.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="short-icon"><img src="https://cdn7.bigcommerce.com/s-t5coov3flx/product_images/uploaded_images/arrow.png" alt="img" /></span>Products claiming to use long staple cotton may not be accurate when in fact a significant portion do not qualify in length.</li>
<li><span class="short-icon"><img src="https://cdn7.bigcommerce.com/s-t5coov3flx/product_images/uploaded_images/arrow.png" alt="img" /></span>When shorter fibers are mixed into production, the resulting yarn is weak and uneven.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sleep Wooven uses combed cotton, which is an expensive process that discards shorter fibers before they are woven into fabric. Compared to the industry standard, our linens are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="short-icon"><img src="https://cdn7.bigcommerce.com/s-t5coov3flx/product_images/uploaded_images/arrow.png" alt="img" /></span>smoother and stronge</li>
<li><span class="short-icon"><img src="https://cdn7.bigcommerce.com/s-t5coov3flx/product_images/uploaded_images/arrow.png" alt="img" /></span>withstands 2x the amount of wear and tear</li>

<p>Our linens feels phenomenal to the touch because we use a process typically used only in high fashion called &ldquo;mercerization&rdquo;. This alters the pH of our cotton and makes the bedding:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="short-icon"><img src="https://cdn7.bigcommerce.com/s-t5coov3flx/product_images/uploaded_images/arrow.png" alt="img" /></span>resistant to mildew</li>
<li><span class="short-icon"><img src="https://cdn7.bigcommerce.com/s-t5coov3flx/product_images/uploaded_images/arrow.png" alt="img" /></span>colorfast during your wash cycle</li>
<li><span class="short-icon"><img src="https://cdn7.bigcommerce.com/s-t5coov3flx/product_images/uploaded_images/arrow.png" alt="img" /></span>adds lustre, durability &amp; smoothness</li>
</ul>
<p>Most fancy beddings stop here, but we listened to our customers and go one step further for the perfect rest. Customers with sensitive skin might develop an itch with new linens when its pH levels are too high even after the first couple washes. Using a proprietary method, we fine tune the pH levels so that it matches closer to natural skin, making our bedding the perfect choice for hypoallergenic customers and families with young children.</p>

<p>Sleep Wooven only uses environmentally low-impact dyes that are AZO free. AZO compounds in traditional dye are cheaper but carcinogenic and devastating to the environment.</p>
<p>Sleep Wooven is committed to saving the environment from further damage and use only dyes that comply with strict EU regulations. Formaldehyde is also a common additive to fabrics in the textile industry to make them wrinkle free and mildew resistant.</p>
<p>Sleep Wooven does not use formaldehyde in our bed linens, because we know it is a carcinogen that triggers severe allergic reaction for some people even in small amounts. We are proud to offer bed linens that feel great, but also safety standards that exceed other brands.</p>
