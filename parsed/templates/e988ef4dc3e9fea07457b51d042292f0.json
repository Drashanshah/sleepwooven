Use a cold or warm wash cycle and set the dryer to low or medium tumble\r\n                                dry. Bleach is not recommended as it destroys the chemical structure of cotton, causing them\r\n                                to be brittle. Use color safe bleach alternatives if necessary and spot-treated required\r\n                                areas.\r\n                                <img class=\"center\"\r\n                                     src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/A8ubqWHaE5rRIqHNgvjvA9wnk2DoWvP5KhXJe4_2wpEOwTZOz7oykaBPvZbH7q6fLF4L2OczQMii135CzHy2KcdQcPQ_BuoPck5FBPm760F1fL1jEFYO7ovcXhL2brCA1_20dFX3\"\r\n                                     alt=\"wash and care label bed linens\">\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </li>\r\n                    <li>\r\n                        <div class=\"faq-title\">\r\n                            <div class=\"number-box\">02</div>\r\n                            <span class=\"accordion-subtitle\">How should I store my linens</span>\r\n                            <span class=\"plus-minus\"></span>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div class=\"faq-content faq-content-2\">\r\n                            <p>\r\n                                Always wash bed linens and thoroughly dry them before any long term storage. We naturally\r\n                                shed dead skin cells and leave body oils all over our personal items, especially on our bed\r\n                                sheets if we spend 8 hours a day on them. If left uncleaned for long periods of time, they\r\n                                oxidize with cotton which gives off odor and a nasty yellow tint. To prevent mold and mildew\r\n                                from forming, use an airtight vacuum bag to store the linens in a cool and dark place.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </li>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div class=\"accordion-segment\">\r\n                    <li>\r\n                        <div class=\"faq-title\">\r\n                            <div class=\"number-box\">03</div>\r\n                            <span class=\"accordion-subtitle\">How does the 100 Day Guarantee work?</span>\r\n                            <span class=\"plus-minus\"></span>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div class=\"faq-content faq-content-3\">\r\n                            <p>Starting from the shipping date, our 100 Day Guarantee is a way to make sure you are truly\r\n                                comfortable with the bedding products before committing to the purchase.</p>\r\n                            <p>While used bedding cannot be resold to another customer, we encourage you to donate them to a\r\n                                charity to serve families and individuals in need.</p>\r\n                            <p>Simply contact us via sleepwooven@haucapital.com or using the chat box below and your\r\n                                original form of payment will be refunded minus 15% for processing and handling fees.</p>\r\n                            <p>The offer is not applicable to the trial pillowcase.</p>\r\n                            <p>Returns are only applicable to a customerâ€™s first order.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </li>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>"}
