                                To keep our bedding fresh and clean, wash them at least once per week with alternating sets
                                for best results. Use a cold or warm wash cycle and set the dryer to low or medium tumble
                                dry.

                                Bleach is not recommended as it destroys the chemical structure of cotton, causing them
                                to be brittle. Use color safe bleach alternatives if necessary and spot-treated required
                                areas.

                                Always wash bed linens and thoroughly dry them before any long term storage. We naturally
                                shed dead skin cells and leave body oils all over our personal items, especially on our bed
                                sheets if we spend 8 hours a day on them. 
                            </p>
                            <p> If left uncleaned for long periods of time, they
                                oxidize with cotton which gives off odor and a nasty yellow tint. To prevent mold and mildew
                                from forming, use an airtight vacuum bag to store the linens in a cool and dark place.
